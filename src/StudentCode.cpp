// Implement your functions here.

































// Functions used is template: 
//     - allows the same function to operate on different data types without rewriting it
//     - generic code ensures reusability and type safety
//     - here used to sort & search accounts based on criteria (from STL used std::sort & std::find_if  for searching)
//     - used lambda expression as well  for custom logic like comparing balances or searching by account holder name
